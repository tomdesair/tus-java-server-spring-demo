# tus-java-server-spring-demo
Tus java server demo using Spring Boot that uses the [tus-java-server library](https://github.com/tomdesair/tus-java-server/) and the [Uppy file uploader](https://uppy.io/) in order to easily provide asynchronous and resumable file uploads in Spring.

To build and run this demo, execute the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tomdesair/tus-java-server-spring-demo.git
$ cd tus-java-server-spring-demo
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar spring-boot-rest/target/spring-boot-rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser and try to upload a file using the Uppy file uploader.

## Que?
* Module `spring-boot-rest` provides the API backend for receiving tus file uploads:
    1. Method `me.desair.spring.tus.App#tusFileUploadService` create a `TusFileUploadService` Spring bean based on the Spring Boot configuration that can be auto-wired into other beans.
    1. The `me.desair.spring.tus.FileUploadController` provides the `/api/upload` endpoint and passes all request directly to that `TusFileUploadService` bean.
    1. Class `me.desair.spring.tus.client.UploadScript` is a script to upload a file using the `tus-java-client` library and can be ignored.
    1. File `src/main/resources/public/index.html` contains the actual home page and loads the Uppy JavaScript file generated by the `uppy-file-upload` module.

* Module `uppy-file-upload` contains the Webpack and Uppy configuration to fetch and join all required JavaScript files. This is not a production ready setup! 
    1. File `uppy-file-upload/app/uppy-fileupload.js` contains the configuration parameters of the Uppy tus JS client.
